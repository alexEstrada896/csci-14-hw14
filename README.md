2. (6 pts) Write a complete program in a cpp file that uses a structure to store the following
weather data for a particular month:
● Total Rainfall
● High Temperature
● Low Temperature
● Average Temperature
The program should have an array of 6 structures to hold weather data for half a year.
The program should define an enumerated data type with enumerators for the months
(JANUARY, FEBRUARY, etc.). The program should use the enumerated type to step
through the elements of the array. When the program runs, it should prompt the user to
enter data for each month, except the average temperature which should be calculated:
(High Temperature + Low Temperature)/2.0).
Once the data are entered for all 6 months, the program should calculate and display the
total rainfall for the half year, the average monthly rainfall, the highest and lowest
temperatures (and the months they occurred in), and the average of all the monthly
average temperatures.
